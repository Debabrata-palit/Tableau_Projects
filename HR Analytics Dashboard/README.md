- The HR Analytics Dashboard project using Tableau is designed to provide insights into key metrics and trends related to human resource management in an organization.
- The dashboard includes several key visualizations that provide a comprehensive overview of HR-related metrics, including employee turnover rate, headcount, and employee engagement levels.
- In addition to these metrics, the dashboard provides insights into employee performance, including metrics related to training and development, performance appraisals, and career progression.
